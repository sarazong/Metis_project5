## Metis_project5: Books Worth Reading
### Description:
We read for different reasons, such as for mental stimulation, stress reduction, knowledge, ect. However, reading a book from end to end takes a good amount of time. Before we invest our time to read a book, we may want to have an idea of whether the book is worthy of our time. A book recommender not only could help readers pick out their reads, but also could increase readers' satisfaction by providing recommendation the readers would enjoy. In this project, using web-scraped data and natural language processing techniques, I built a content-based book recommender.
